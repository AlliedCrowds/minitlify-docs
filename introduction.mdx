## Pagination and Data Format

### 1. Pagination
Our API uses **cursor-based pagination** for all endpoints. To retrieve the next page of results for a given endpoint, use the `cursor` value provided in the response of the previous request.

### 2. Data Format
All data returned by the API is provided in a compressed [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org) format, typically in `.gz` compression. You do not need to extract these files beforehand, as libraries such as `pandas` can handle reading compressed files directly.

### 3. Processing Large Files
Due to the large volume of data, it is recommended to read the data in chunks to optimize performance. Below is an example using Python and the `pandas` library to process a compressed JSON Lines file:

```python read_jsonl_file.py
import pandas as pd

def read_json_file(file_path):
    try:
        # Read the compressed JSON lines file in chunks
        df = pd.read_json(file_path, compression="gzip", lines=True, chunksize=10000)
        for df_chunk in df:
            print(df_chunk.head())
        return df
    except (ValueError, IOError) as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Failed to read the JSON file: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    df = read_json_file("price_explorer.jsonl.gz")
```



- **Compression Handling:** The `pandas` library can read compressed files directly, so files do not need to be manually extracted before processing.
- **Reading in Chunks:** To handle large files efficiently, the data is read in manageable chunks using the `chunksize` parameter. The chunk size can be adjusted based on the clientâ€™s memory and performance requirements.

### 4. Download URLs
Any download URLs provided by the API are valid for **one minute** after the request is made. Ensure that you download the files within this time frame to avoid errors.
